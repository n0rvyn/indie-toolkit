## Overview

Lightweight evaluation: only runs Demand Authenticity and the Elevator Pitch test. No full agent dispatch; runs directly in the main context for speed. This is a 5-minute first-pass filter.

## Process

### Step 1: Quick Product Understanding

- **Local project:** Read README + scan top-level directory structure. Identify the core value proposition.
- **External app / idea:** Use the user's description. Do a single WebSearch for the product if needed.
- **No argument:** Use current working directory.

Do not deep-dive into code. This is a surface-level scan.

### Step 2: Detect Platform and Load Framework

Same platform detection logic as evaluate skill:
- Check for `.xcodeproj` / `Package.swift` → iOS
- Check for `package.json` → Web
- Otherwise ask or infer

Locate reference files by searching for `**/product-lens/references/dimensions/01-demand-authenticity.md`.

Read:
1. `dimensions/01-demand-authenticity.md` — extract:
   - Universal sub-questions
   - Platform-specific sub-questions (from `### iOS` if iOS detected, otherwise `### Default`)
   - Scoring anchors
2. `modules/elevator-pitch.md` — extract:
   - Default constraints
   - Platform-specific constraints (from `### iOS` under `## Platform Constraints` if iOS detected)
   - Judgment criteria

### Step 3: Demand Dimension Assessment

Answer the dimension's sub-questions using available evidence:
- README claims and problem statement
- Quick code structure scan (is 80% of code serving core value?)
- User's own description of the problem being solved

Score 1-5 stars with one-sentence justification.

### Step 4: Elevator Pitch Test

Attempt to write:
- Tagline (<=30 chars) — apply platform-specific constraints if iOS
- First description sentence

Judge: Clear / Vague / Cannot articulate

### Step 5: Quick Alternative Scan

Run 2-3 WebSearches:
- `"best [category] app [year]"`
- `"[problem description] alternative"`
- `"[category] indie app"` (if relevant)

Note top 3-5 alternatives and their approach. This is not a full market scan — just enough to answer "is someone already doing this well?"

### Step 6: Verdict

Output one of three verdicts:

| Verdict | Criteria | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Pass** | Demand >=3★ AND Pitch not "Cannot articulate" AND alternatives are beatable | Green light: proceed to full evaluation or building |
| **Caution** | Demand 3★ with Pitch "Cannot articulate", OR Demand 2★ with Pitch "Clear", OR dominant alternative exists but has clear gaps | Investigate further: run full `/evaluate` before committing |
| **Fail** | Demand <=2★ AND no differentiation angle, OR Pitch "Cannot articulate" AND problem already solved well by free tools | Reconsider: this idea needs significant rethinking |

## Output Format
