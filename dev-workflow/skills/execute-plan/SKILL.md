description: "Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute. Batch execution with review checkpoints."

## Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read the plan file
2. **Verification pre-check**: Look for a `## Verification` section with `Verdict: Approved` in the plan file
   - If found: verification is done, continue
   - If not found: invoke `dev-workflow:verify-plan` before proceeding
3. Review critically — identify gaps, ambiguities, or concerns
4. If concerns: raise them before starting. Do not proceed with a plan you disagree with
5. If no concerns: proceed to execution

### Step 2: Execute in Batches

Default batch size: 3 tasks.

**Before starting each batch (if search tool available):**
1. Collect task titles and key technical terms from the batch (file names, API names, component names mentioned in task steps)
2. Call `search(query="<batch task titles and keywords>", source_type=["error", "lesson"], project_root="<cwd>")`
3. If results are returned: present them as "Relevant lessons for this batch:" before executing any task in the batch
4. If the search tool is unavailable or returns no results: skip silently and begin task execution

For each task in the batch:
1. Read the task fully before starting
2. If the task has design anchor fields (Design ref, Expected values, etc.), read the referenced design section first
3. Follow steps exactly as written
4. Run all verification commands
5. If verification fails: stop and report, do not guess at fixes

### Step 3: Checkpoint Report

After each batch, report:
- What was implemented (per task)
- Verification output (pass/fail)
- Any deviations from the plan and why

**Decision Points:** If the plan file contains a `## Decisions` section with unresolved decisions (no `**Chosen:**` line), present them before the first batch:
- For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
- For each `recommended` decision: present as a group — "The plan has {N} unresolved recommended decisions. Accept all defaults, or review individually?"
- Record user choices: edit the plan file, replace `**Recommendation:**` with `**Chosen:** {user's choice}`

Then say: **"Ready for feedback before next batch."**

Wait for user feedback. Apply requested changes before continuing.

### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:
- Apply corrections
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until all tasks complete

### Step 5: Wrap Up

When all tasks are done:
- Run full project build/test if applicable
- Suggest `dev-workflow:implementation-reviewer` agent for plan-vs-code audit
- Suggest `dev-workflow:finish-branch` for branch integration

## Safety Rules

- **Never start implementation on main/master** without explicit user consent
- **Don't skip verifications** — even if you're confident the code is correct
- **Stop when blocked** — hit a blocker mid-batch? Stop and ask. Don't guess.
- **Plan has critical gaps?** — raise them. Don't fill gaps with assumptions.

## When to Stop and Ask

- Blocker mid-batch that the plan doesn't address
- Plan step is ambiguous or contradictory
- Verification fails repeatedly (2+ times on same step)
- Discovered dependency the plan didn't account for

## State Integration

When running within a phase orchestrated by `run-phase`:

If `.claude/dev-workflow-state.yml` exists and `phase_step` is `execute`:
- After each batch checkpoint (Step 3), update the state file:
  - `batch_progress`: `"{completed}/{total}"` (e.g., `"2/4"`)
  - `last_updated`: current timestamp
- This enables cross-session resume if the session ends mid-execution

## Completion Criteria

- All plan tasks executed and verified
- Full project build passes (Step 5)
- Wrap-up suggestions presented (implementation-reviewer, finish-branch)
