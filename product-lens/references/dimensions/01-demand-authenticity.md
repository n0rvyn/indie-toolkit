# Dimension 1: Demand Authenticity (需求真伪)

**Core question:** Is this pain point painful enough to make people pay an unknown indie developer for a no-brand app?

## Universal Sub-Questions

1. **JTBD analysis:** What job is the user "hiring" this product to do? What are the existing alternatives (including "do nothing")?
2. **Pain frequency x severity:** Where does this fall on the matrix?
   - High-frequency + high-pain = must-have (best case)
   - High-frequency + low-pain = utility/tool (viable if friction-free)
   - Low-frequency + high-pain = insurance-type (hard to market)
   - Low-frequency + low-pain = nice-to-have (dangerous for indie)
3. **Sean Ellis test proxy:** If this product disappears tomorrow, do users scramble for alternatives or shrug?
4. **Code signal check:** Is 80% of code serving the core value proposition, or is the value buried under feature bloat? (local projects only)
5. **User value accumulation:** Does using this product accumulate user-specific value over time (data, skills, habits, content) that grows switching costs?

## Platform-Specific Sub-Questions

### Default

6. **Switching cost from alternatives:** What do users give up by not switching to this product? What do they give up by switching?

### iOS

> iOS core question variant: Are iOS users willing to pay for this from an unknown indie developer, given higher quality expectations on the platform?

6. **iOS willingness-to-pay:** iOS users have higher payment intent than Android, but also higher quality bars. Is this product's polish level sufficient for iOS expectations?
7. **AI & system capability overlap:** Can ChatGPT, Claude, Apple Intelligence, Shortcuts, Widgets, or built-in system features solve this problem? What is the app's incremental value beyond what AI tools and iOS provide for free?
8. **Platform-native job:** Is this a job that users specifically want to do on iPhone/iPad? Or is it better suited to web/desktop?
9. **App Store review signals:** What do negative reviews of competitors say? What jobs are underserved?
10. **Pain frequency on mobile:** Is this a problem users encounter while using their phone, or do they have to go out of their way to open this app?

- External: App Store reviews (complaint themes), Reddit/forum discussions, search volume for the problem

## Scoring Anchors

| Score | Anchor |
|-------|--------|
| ★ | Solving a problem nobody has, or a problem with abundant free solutions |
| ★★ | Real problem but low pain; users tolerate current alternatives |
| ★★★ | Genuine pain point; some users would pay, but alternatives are "good enough" for most |
| ★★★★ | Clear unmet need; existing alternatives have obvious gaps; users actively complain |
| ★★★★★ | Hair-on-fire problem; users already hacking together workarounds; high willingness to pay |
