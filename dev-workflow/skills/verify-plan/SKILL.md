description: "Use when a plan has been written and needs validation before execution, or the user says 'verify plan', 'check the plan', 'review the plan', 'validate plan', '检查计划', '验证计划'. Applies Verification-First method with falsifiable error candidates, failure reverse reasoning, optional Design Token consistency checks, Design Faithfulness anchoring, and Architecture Review."

## Overview

This skill dispatches the `plan-verifier` agent to validate an implementation plan in a separate context, keeping the main conversation lean.

**Optional flag: `--fast`**
When passed: use Sonnet instead of Opus for verification.
Appropriate for plans with < 5 tasks or simple single-concern changes.
Default (no flag): Opus for thorough verification.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the following before dispatching:

1. **Plan file path** — identify from:
   - Most recent `write-plan` output in conversation
   - User-specified path
   - Search `docs/06-plans/*.md` for recent plan files
2. **Design doc path** — check the plan header for a `Design doc:` reference; if none, set to "none"
3. **Project root** — current working directory

If the plan file path is unclear, ask the user.

### Step 1.5: Retrieve Error Patterns (if search tool available)

After collecting plan and design doc paths, extract technical keywords from the plan (framework names, API names, component names found in the plan file) and search for known error patterns:

1. Call `search(query="<technical keywords from plan>", source_type=["error", "lesson"], project_root="<cwd>")`
2. If results are returned: collect them as `retrieved_context` — a compact list of (source_path, section, content preview) for each hit
3. If the search tool is unavailable or returns no results: set `retrieved_context` to empty and continue

### Step 2: Dispatch Agent

Use the Task tool to launch the `plan-verifier` agent:
- Default (no --fast): add `model: "opus"` to the Task tool call
- With --fast flag: add `model: "sonnet"` to the Task tool call

Note: must explicitly set model; the parent session runs Sonnet and inheritance gives Sonnet, not Opus.

Structure the task prompt as:

```
Verify this implementation plan:

Plan file: {path}
Design doc: {path or "none"}
Project root: {path}

Retrieved error patterns and lessons (from knowledge base):
{retrieved_context — one entry per line, or "none" if empty}
```

### Step 3: Present Results

When the agent completes:

1. The agent returns a compact summary with verdict, issue counts, and report file path
2. Present the summary to the user
3. Report the verdict:
   - **Approved** — proceed to Step 4
   - **Must revise** — the summary includes revision items; apply revisions to the plan, then re-dispatch the verifier (max 2 revision cycles)
4. For detailed analysis: read the full report at the path returned by the agent

### Step 4: Mark Verified

When the plan is approved:

1. Append a verification marker to the end of the plan file:

```markdown

---
## Verification
- **Verdict:** Approved
- **Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

2. Suggest next step: `dev-workflow:execute-plan`

## Completion Criteria

- Plan file has `## Verification` section with `Verdict: Approved` appended
- Or: user explicitly chose to proceed after 2 revision cycles (verdict noted as "partial")
