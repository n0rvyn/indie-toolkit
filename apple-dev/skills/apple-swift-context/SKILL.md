## Purpose

Load the relevant sections of `references/apple-swift-rules.md` based on the current task. Do not read the entire file unless the task requires rules from every section.

## Section-Targeted Reading Process

### Step 1: Identify relevant sections

Grep for section markers in the file:

```
Grep("<!-- section:", "references/apple-swift-rules.md")
```

This returns lines like:
```
3:<!-- section: Build-Check-Fix Cycle keywords: build, xcodebuild, check, fix -->
```

### Step 2: Match sections to current task

From the current task description, identify which keyword sets are relevant:

| Task involves | Read section(s) |
|---|---|
| Running builds, checking errors | Build-Check-Fix Cycle |
| Any Swift code (always apply) | 通用约束 |
| async/await, actors, @Model, Sendable | Swift 6 并发原则 |
| Existing foregroundColor calls | .foregroundColor 迁移策略 |
| Creating new UI, layout changes | iOS UI 规则（分层生效） |
| New triggers, data paths, schedulers | 计划阶段架构审查（条件触发） |
| Plan with ≥3 file changes | 计划自检（M&M 测试） |
| Writing a plan | 计划编写原则 |
| Starting execution of a plan | 计划执行原则 |
| Interruption during execution | 计划执行中断处理（必须遵守） |
| User reported a behavior bug | 错误修复原则 |
| Deleting code or variables | 删除代码原则, 死代码/未接入代码处置原则 |
| Working with iOS 18 APIs (@Entry, Tab, MeshGradient, @Previewable) | swift-api-changes-ios18 |
| Working with iOS 26 APIs (glassEffect, FoundationModels) | swift-api-changes-ios26 |
| Seeing deprecation warnings in Xcode | swift-api-changes-ios18 (migration), validate-design-tokens |
| Using TabView | swift-api-changes-ios18 → TabView Architecture |
| Adding LLM/AI features | swift-api-changes-ios26 → Foundation Models |
| macOS window, WindowGroup, MenuBarExtra, Settings scene | macOS Window Management |
| macOS menu, commands, CommandMenu, toolbar customization | macOS Menu & Toolbar |
| Keyboard shortcut on macOS, keyboardShortcut | macOS Keyboard Shortcuts |
| NSViewRepresentable, macOS SwiftUI, pasteboard, onHover | macOS SwiftUI Patterns |
| macOS distribution, notarization, Developer ID | macos-distribution-guide |
| macOS sandbox, entitlements, file access permissions | macos-distribution-guide → Sandboxing & Entitlements |
| macOS auto-update, Sparkle | macos-distribution-guide → Auto-Update |

### Step 2.5: Platform-aware section filtering

Section markers may include a `platform:` attribute (e.g., `platform: iOS`, `platform: macOS`). Sections without a `platform:` tag apply to all platforms (shared).

The target platform is determined by which rows matched in Step 2:

- If Step 2 matched any **macOS keyword row** (rows 50-56: WindowGroup, MenuBarExtra, CommandMenu, keyboardShortcut, NSViewRepresentable, notarization, Sparkle) → the task involves macOS. When grepping `apple-swift-rules.md`, also include sections with `platform: macOS`.
- If Step 2 matched any **iOS keyword row** (rows 45-48: iOS 18/26 APIs, TabView, glassEffect) → the task involves iOS. When grepping reference files, also include sections with `platform: iOS`.
- If Step 2 matched **only shared rows** (rows 33-44: build cycle, concurrency, plan rules, bug fix) → load only sections without a `platform:` tag.
- Both platforms can be active simultaneously (e.g., a multiplatform project).

### Step 3: Read only the matched sections

For each matched section in `apple-swift-rules.md`, use the line number from the Grep result as
`offset` and read until the next section marker or approximately 60 lines (whichever comes first):

```
Read("references/apple-swift-rules.md", offset=<section_line>, limit=<next_section_line - section_line>)
```

For `swift-api-changes-*` and `macos-distribution-guide.md` files: search for the specific section
keyword rather than reading the entire file. Example:

```
Grep("glassEffect", "references/swift-api-changes-ios26.md")
→ Read("references/swift-api-changes-ios26.md", offset=<section_line>, limit=<lines_to_next_section>)

Grep("notarytool", "references/macos-distribution-guide.md")
→ Read("references/macos-distribution-guide.md", offset=<section_line>, limit=<lines_to_next_section>)
```

If the task is not clearly scoped (e.g., the task description is very broad or covers the whole codebase), read `通用约束` and `Swift 6 并发原则` at minimum — these two sections apply to all Swift work.

### Step 4: Apply the loaded rules

Follow the rules from the loaded sections strictly. Do not infer rules from memory about sections that were not read.

## External API References

For Apple framework API details NOT covered by `references/apple-swift-rules.md`, route to vabole/apple-skills:

- **Entry**: `apple-skills:ios-dev` — coordinator + SwiftUI correctness checklist + topic router for SwiftUI/UIKit/SwiftData/Concurrency/Testing/Liquid Glass
- **Framework refs**: `apple-skills:swiftui` `apple-skills:swiftdata` `apple-skills:storekit` `apple-skills:widgetkit` `apple-skills:appintents` `apple-skills:healthkit` `apple-skills:mapkit` `apple-skills:eventkit` `apple-skills:photosui` `apple-skills:corehaptics` `apple-skills:usernotifications` `apple-skills:backgroundtasks` `apple-skills:tipkit` `apple-skills:combine` `apple-skills:uikit` `apple-skills:swift-concurrency` `apple-skills:swift-testing` `apple-skills:xcuitest` `apple-skills:ios-liquid-glass` `apple-skills:hig`
- **Tooling**: `apple-skills:simulator-utils` (截图 + sim 管理), `apple-skills:apple-docs-index` (查 API 在哪 framework), `apple-skills:apple-aso` (ASO 优化)

**Rule**: Don't guess Apple APIs from memory. If task involves an API not loaded from `apple-swift-rules.md` → grep the matching apple-skills ref first; or route through `apple-skills:ios-dev` if unsure which ref applies.
