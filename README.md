## Cross-Plugin Knowledge Flow

For PKOS-integrated plugins, the repo follows these cross-plugin rules:

1. **Markdown first; Notion second**
   - Local Markdown is the fact source.
   - Notion is the management view for status, sorting, and dashboards.

2. **Producer plugins do not own final vault placement**
   - Plugins such as `domain-intel`, `product-lens`, and `session-reflect` should produce structured results.
   - They should publish those results into a PKOS-owned ingress / exchange layer, not write directly into final vault locations with plugin-specific rules.

3. **PKOS owns ingestion**
   - PKOS applies canonical tags, deduplication, note placement, ripple compilation, and downstream sync rules.
   - This keeps one ingestion authority for the vault instead of each plugin inventing its own storage logic.

4. **Stable decisions are promoted, not dumped**
   - High-frequency outputs belong in `signal` / `verdict` style notes.
   - Only stable, user-confirmed conclusions should become `crystal` notes.

5. **Cross-plugin precedent**
   - `domain-intel` writes into its own workspace and `pkos:intel-sync` imports into PKOS.
   - `pkos:inbox` already acts as a multi-source ingestion entry for raw captures.
   - `product-lens` should follow the same separation of concerns: produce structured analysis; let PKOS ingest and organize it.

At a glance, the intended flow is:

```text
Producer plugin
  -> PKOS ingress / exchange
  -> PKOS vault ingestion and enrichment
  -> Obsidian / local Markdown as source of truth
  -> Notion summary sync as management projection
```

## Codex / OpenCode

Both Codex and OpenCode use file-based installation. The sources of truth are:

- Codex: `.codex/INSTALL.md`
- OpenCode: `.opencode/INSTALL.md`

Skills for each platform are linked via these install guides. Each plugin's `skills/` folder contains its skill definitions.
