# Dimension 3: Market Space (市场空间)

**Core question:** Is this niche big enough to sustain one person, and small enough that big companies won't bother?

## Universal Sub-Questions

1. **Niche viability:** Is the addressable market large enough for indie-scale revenue ($5K-$50K/month) but small enough to fly under enterprise radar?
2. **Competition density:** How many direct competitors exist? Are they well-funded or also indie?
3. **Indirect substitutes:** What non-obvious alternatives exist (spreadsheets, manual processes, general-purpose tools)?
4. **Timing:** Why now? What has changed (infrastructure, user habits, platform capabilities, regulations) that makes this viable today?
5. **Small-cut-deep-cut viability:** Is this niche narrow enough that AI platforms won't build a dedicated solution, yet deep enough that general AI tools can't serve it well?

## Platform-Specific Sub-Questions

### Default

6. **Differentiation statement:** One sentence on why a user would switch from the top competitor. If you can't write this sentence, score <=2.

### iOS

> iOS core question variant: Is this App Store category viable for an indie, or is it dominated by mega-publishers with acquisition budgets?

7. **Category saturation:** How many apps in this App Store category? What's the quality bar of the top 10?
8. **ASO keyword competition:** Are the primary search keywords crowded with well-funded apps? Can you rank for long-tail keywords?
9. **Mega-publisher dominance:** Is this category controlled by companies with marketing budgets (Calm, Headspace pattern)? Or is it indie-friendly?
10. **App Store editorial potential:** Is this the type of app Apple features in "Apps We Love" or seasonal collections? (Design quality, platform integration, and privacy focus increase editorial chances)
11. **Geographic niche:** Is there a language/region-specific opportunity that global competitors ignore?
12. **New platform early-mover:** Is there a visionOS or watchOS version opportunity? Early presence on new Apple platforms significantly increases Apple editorial feature probability.

## Scoring Anchors

| Score | Anchor |
|-------|--------|
| ★ | Saturated market with well-funded incumbents; no differentiation angle |
| ★★ | Crowded but possible; differentiation is marginal ("slightly better UI") |
| ★★★ | Viable niche; some competitors but clear angle; timing is neutral |
| ★★★★ | Underserved niche; few competitors; favorable timing signal |
| ★★★★★ | Clear gap in market; timing is perfect; differentiation is obvious and defensible |
