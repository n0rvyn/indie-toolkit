# Pivot Directions

**Purpose:** Not starting from zero -- given existing code assets and domain knowledge, what adjacent directions could you pivot to?

## Methodology

1. Inventory existing assets:
   - Code: what reusable components, data models, integrations exist?
   - Knowledge: what domain expertise has been accumulated?
   - Data: what user data or content has been created?
   - Audience: what users or community has been built?
2. For each asset, brainstorm adjacent problems it could solve
3. Filter: which pivot directions have better dimension scores than the current direction?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Pivot Directions

Alternative directions based on existing assets:
- **[Direction A]:** [description] -- leverages existing [asset]
- **[Direction B]:** [description] -- leverages existing [asset]
- **[Direction C]:** [description] -- leverages existing [asset]
```
