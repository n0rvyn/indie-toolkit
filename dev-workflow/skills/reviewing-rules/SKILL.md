## Overview

This skill dispatches the `dev-workflow:rules-auditor` agent to audit CLAUDE.md rules in a separate context, keeping the main conversation lean.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the following before dispatching:

1. **Deviation description** — from the user's message (e.g., "Claude added animations without asking"). Set to "periodic check" if none provided
2. **Global CLAUDE.md path** — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. **Project CLAUDE.md path** — check for `CLAUDE.md` in project root (may not exist)

### Step 2: Dispatch Agent

Use the Task tool to launch the `dev-workflow:rules-auditor` agent with all gathered context. Structure the task prompt as:

```
Audit CLAUDE.md rules with the following inputs:

Deviation description: {description or "periodic check"}
Global CLAUDE.md: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Project CLAUDE.md: {path or "none"}
```

### Step 3: Present Results

When the agent completes:

1. Present the Rules Review Report returned by the agent
2. **Decision Points:** Check the agent's return for `Decisions:` count.
   - If Decisions > 0: read the `## Decisions` section from the report
   - For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
   - For each `recommended` decision: present as a group — "The audit has {N} recommended decisions with defaults. Accept all defaults, or review individually?"
   - Record user choices in conversation (note which option was chosen for each DP)
3. If fix recommendations were made:
   - List each recommendation
   - Ask the user: "Execute these fixes?"
4. If user approves: apply the recommended changes to the CLAUDE.md files
5. If user declines: done

## Completion Criteria

- Audit report presented to user
- If fixes recommended: user has approved or declined each recommendation
- If approved: changes applied to CLAUDE.md files
