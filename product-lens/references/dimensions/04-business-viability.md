# Dimension 4: Business Viability (商业可行)

**Core question:** After the platform takes its cut, can this generate sustainable indie-scale income through discoverable channels?

## Universal Sub-Questions

1. **Revenue model clarity:** Who pays, why, how much? Is the model proven in this category?
2. **Willingness-to-pay signals:** Are users already paying for inferior alternatives? Or is "free" the expected price in this category?
3. **Pricing power:** Can you charge premium (>$4.99/month) or is this a race-to-bottom category?

## Platform-Specific Sub-Questions

### Default

4. **Unit economics at indie scale:** Not LTV/CAC ratios -- can you reach $5K+/month with realistic conversion rates and zero marketing budget?
5. **Discovery channels:** How do users find this product? Is there at least one organic channel (SEO, ASO, word-of-mouth, community)?

### iOS

> iOS core question variant: After Apple's 30% cut (or 15% small business program), can this generate sustainable income through App Store-native discovery?

4. **Subscription vs. one-time purchase:** Which model fits the value delivery? Subscription requires ongoing value; one-time requires volume.
5. **After the cut:** At target price minus 30% (or 15%), how many paying users needed for $5K/month? Is that realistic given category download volume?
6. **App Store as discovery channel:** Can ASO alone drive sufficient installs, or does this require external marketing? Include In-App Events as a free visibility mechanism -- scheduled content events that appear in App Store search and browse.
7. **Trial/paywall conversion:** What's the category-standard free trial length? Is the value demonstrable within that window?
8. **Family Sharing / volume impact:** Does Family Sharing (one purchase, 6 users) significantly impact unit economics?
9. **ATT impact:** If the app relies on advertising revenue, how does App Tracking Transparency affect the business model? Post-ATT, ad-supported indie apps face significantly reduced ad revenue.

## Evidence Sources

- Local: Pricing/monetization code, subscription tiers, paywall implementation
- External: Competitor pricing, App Store category pricing norms, review volume as demand proxy

## Scoring Anchors

| Score | Anchor |
|-------|--------|
| ★ | No clear revenue model; category expects free; no discovery channel |
| ★★ | Revenue model exists but unproven in category; discovery requires paid acquisition |
| ★★★ | Standard model for category; at least one organic discovery channel; modest pricing power |
| ★★★★ | Users demonstrably pay in this category; multiple discovery channels; room for premium pricing |
| ★★★★★ | Strong willingness to pay; viral/organic discovery built-in; pricing power from differentiation |
