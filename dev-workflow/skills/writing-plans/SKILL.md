## Overview

This skill dispatches the `plan-writer` agent to generate an implementation plan in a separate context, keeping the main conversation lean.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the following before dispatching:

1. **Goal** — one sentence describing what the plan achieves (from user request, dev-guide Phase, or conversation context)
2. **Scope items** — list of features/components to implement
3. **Acceptance criteria** — verifiable completion conditions (from dev-guide Phase or user)
4. **Design doc reference** — path to design doc if one exists (search `docs/06-plans/*-design.md`)
5. **Project root** — current working directory

If any of these are unclear, ask the user before dispatching.

### Step 2: Dispatch Agent

Use the Task tool to launch the `plan-writer` agent with all gathered context. Structure the task prompt as:

```
Write an implementation plan with the following inputs:

Goal: {goal}
Scope:
- {item 1}
- {item 2}

Acceptance criteria:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}

Design doc: {path or "none"}
Project root: {path}

Additional context:
{any relevant details from the conversation}
```

### Step 3: Present Results

When the agent completes:

1. Read the plan file the agent created
2. Present a summary to the user:
   - Plan file path
   - Number of tasks
   - Key files to be created/modified
3. Suggest next step: `dev-workflow:verifying-plans` to validate the plan before execution
