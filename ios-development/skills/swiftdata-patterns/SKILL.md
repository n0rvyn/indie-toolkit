# SwiftData Patterns Skill

Provide interactive guidance on SwiftData best practices based on `references/swiftdata-guide.md`.

## When to Use

- User asks about SwiftData usage
- Designing data models
- Questions about relationships, queries, or migrations
- Concurrency issues with SwiftData

## Process

### 1. Identify User's Need

Determine what aspect of SwiftData the user needs help with:
- @Model definition
- Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Querying with @Query
- Data migration
- Concurrency safety

### 2. Read Reference Guide

Read `references/swiftdata-guide.md` section corresponding to the user's need.

### 3. Provide Contextual Guidance

Based on user's specific scenario:

**For @Model definition**:
- Show basic pattern from guide Section 1
- Discuss optional vs required properties
- Explain @Transient and @Attribute modifiers

**For Relationships**:
- Show relationship patterns from guide Section 2
- Explain delete rules (.cascade, .nullify, .deny)
- Demonstrate inverse relationships

**For Querying**:
- Show @Query patterns from guide Section 3
- Demonstrate predicates for filtering
- Show sort descriptors
- Explain dynamic query initialization

**For Migration**:
- Explain versioned schemas from guide Section 4
- Show migration plan setup
- Discuss lightweight vs custom migrations

**For Concurrency**:
- Explain @MainActor usage from guide Section 5
- Show ModelContext thread safety
- Demonstrate background task patterns

### 4. Provide Code Examples

Extract relevant code examples from the guide and adapt to user's context.

### 5. Highlight Common Pitfalls

- Cross-thread ModelContext usage
- Forgetting to call save()
- Overusing relationships (performance)
- Not handling migration for schema changes

## Success Criteria

- User understands the SwiftData pattern for their scenario
- Code example is directly applicable
- Common mistakes are avoided
