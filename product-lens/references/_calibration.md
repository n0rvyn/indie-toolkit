# Indie Developer Calibration

> This preamble is injected into every dimension evaluator. It frames the evaluation perspective.

## How Indie Evaluation Differs from Enterprise PM

| Aspect | Enterprise PM | Indie Developer |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Market sizing | TAM in billions | Niche big enough for one person |
| Competition | Market share battles | Finding gaps big companies ignore |
| Revenue model | LTV/CAC optimization | After 30% platform cut, what remains? |
| Team scaling | Can we hire fast enough? | Can one person maintain this? |
| Moat | Network effects, patents | Taste, domain expertise, data accumulation |
| Risk | Market risk | Sunk cost fallacy, Sherlock risk |

## Scoring Rubric (1-5 Stars)

All dimensions use a 1-5 star scale with indie-specific anchors:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ★☆☆☆☆ (1) | Fatal flaw: this dimension alone could kill the project |
| ★★☆☆☆ (2) | Serious concern: requires major changes to become viable |
| ★★★☆☆ (3) | Acceptable: not a strength, not a blocker; needs monitoring |
| ★★★★☆ (4) | Strong: clear advantage in this dimension |
| ★★★★★ (5) | Exceptional: rare, defensible strength |

Rule: every score must include a one-sentence justification citing specific evidence (code location, market data, or user signal). Vague assessments ("decent", "not bad", "pretty good") are forbidden.

## Sub-Question Structure

Each dimension's sub-questions are split into two groups:

- **Universal sub-questions:** Always apply regardless of platform. These are platform-neutral analysis questions.
- **Platform-specific sub-questions:** Vary by platform. When an overlay applies (e.g., iOS), the platform-specific questions are replaced with platform-tailored variants. When no overlay is active, use the default platform-specific questions.
