# brainstorm Eval

## Trigger Tests
- "Brainstorm ideas for a new feature"
- "What are some approaches to implement this?"
- "Help me think through the design"
- "design a component"

## Negative Trigger Tests
- "Write the code for this"
- "Choose between option A and B"

## Output Assertions
- [ ] Output explores user intent before design
- [ ] Output presents design options with trade-offs
- [ ] Output does NOT write code before design approval (Hard Gate)
- [ ] 2-3 approaches proposed with comparison table
- [ ] Design document saved to docs/06-plans/

- [ ] Step 2 must require per-question recommended answer + reasoning.
- [ ] Step 2.5 Expectation Alignment Check must exist as a mandatory gate before Step 3 (Propose 2-3 Approaches).

## Redundancy Risk
Baseline comparison: Base model can brainstorm but lacks explicit hard gate separating design from implementation
Last tested model: Opus 4.6
Last tested date: 2026-03-08
Verdict: monitor
