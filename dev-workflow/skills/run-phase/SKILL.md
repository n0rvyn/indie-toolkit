## Overview

This skill orchestrates one iteration of the development cycle by dispatching agents for document-generation steps and keeping only code execution in the main context.

```
Locate/Resume Phase
  → scope confirmation checkpoint (main context)
  → dispatch dev-workflow:plan-writer agent (separate context)
  → UX review checkpoint (main context — if design has UX Assertions)
  → invoke dev-workflow:verify-plan skill (separate context)
  → execute plan (main context — writes code)
  → dispatch dev-workflow:feature-spec-writer agent (separate context)
  → dispatch review agents in parallel (separate contexts)
  → fix gaps (main context)
  → Phase done
```

It does not do the work itself. It dispatches agents and coordinates the sequence.

## State File

Location: `.claude/dev-workflow-state.yml`

This file tracks progress across sessions. Update it **before** starting each step (so crash-resume works). Read/write via the Read and Write tools.

```yaml
project: <name>
current_phase: 2
phase_name: "Phase Name"
phase_step: plan    # plan | ux-review | verify | execute | spec | review | fix | done
dev_guide: docs/06-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-project-dev-guide.md
plan_file: null
verification_report: null
batch_progress: null
review_reports: []
gaps_remaining: 0
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
```

## Process

### Step 1: Resume or Locate Phase

1. Check for `.claude/dev-workflow-state.yml` (Read tool)
   - If exists AND `phase_step` is not `done`:
     - Present: "Phase {N} ({name}) in progress — step: {phase_step}. Resume?"
     - If user accepts: skip to the step indicated by `phase_step`
     - If user declines: ask which Phase to start
2. If no state file or starting fresh:
   - Find dev-guide: `docs/06-plans/*-dev-guide.md` (if multiple, ask user)
   - Read the document and check each Phase's acceptance criteria
   - Phases with all criteria checked = completed
   - Identify the first incomplete Phase
   - Present Phase summary: Goal, Scope, Architecture decisions, Acceptance criteria
   - Ask: "Start Phase N?"
3. Initialize state file:

```yaml
project: <from dev-guide title>
current_phase: <N>
phase_name: "<Phase name>"
phase_step: plan
dev_guide: <dev-guide path>
plan_file: null
verification_report: null
batch_progress: null
review_reports: []
gaps_remaining: 0
last_updated: "<now>"
```

If the user specifies a different Phase number, use that instead.

### Step 1.5: Scope Confirmation

Before dispatching plan-writer, present the Phase scope for explicit user confirmation.

**Skip condition:** When resuming from state file with `phase_step` not `plan`, skip this step — scope was already confirmed in a prior session.

1. Read the Phase's scope items from the dev-guide
2. Present them as a numbered list to the user:

```
Phase {N} scope — confirm before planning:

1. {scope item 1}
2. {scope item 2}
...

Confirm these items, or correct before proceeding.
```

3. Wait for user response:
   - User confirms → proceed to Step 2
   - User corrects → edit the Phase's `**Scope:**` bulleted list in the dev-guide file to match user's corrections, re-present for confirmation
   - Max 2 correction cycles; after that, proceed with last-confirmed scope

This checkpoint catches scope pollution introduced during dev-guide updates (AI-added items that were not explicitly requested by the user).

### Step 2: Plan (agent dispatch)

1. Update state: `phase_step: plan`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Gather Phase context from dev-guide:
   - Goal: Phase N's goal
   - Scope: Phase N's scope items
   - Acceptance criteria: Phase N's acceptance criteria
   - Design doc reference: from dev-guide header (if exists)
   - Design analysis reference: search `docs/06-plans/*-design-analysis.md`; if exactly 1 file, use it; if multiple, use the one whose filename matches the Phase's feature topic; if still ambiguous, ask the user; if none, set to "none"
   - Crystal file reference: search `docs/11-crystals/*-crystal.md`; if exactly 1 file, use it; if multiple, ask the user which one applies; if none, set to "none"
   - If no crystal file found AND the Phase has architecture decisions marked as "resolved" in the dev-guide: suggest `/crystallize` to capture these decisions before planning. Do not block — user can decline and proceed without a crystal file.
3. If a design doc path exists: read the design doc and check for a `## UX Assertions` section. Note the result — it controls the dispatch prompt below and Step 2.5.
4. Use the Task tool to dispatch the `dev-workflow:plan-writer` agent:

```
Write an implementation plan with the following inputs:

Goal: {Phase goal}
Scope:
{Phase scope items}

Acceptance criteria:
{Phase acceptance criteria}

Design doc: {path or "none"}
Design analysis: {path or "none"}
Crystal file: {path or "none"}
Project root: {project root}

Context: This is Phase {N} of the dev-guide at {dev-guide path}.
{IF design doc contains ## UX Assertions section, append:}
⚠️ Design doc contains UX Assertions (## UX Assertions section). Read User Journeys and UX Assertions table BEFORE writing UI tasks. Each UI task must include UX ref: and User interaction: fields.
```

5. When agent returns: note the plan file path from the summary
6. Update state: `plan_file: <path>`, `last_updated: <now>`
7. Present plan summary to user (task count, key files)
8. **Decision Points:** Check the plan-writer's return for `Decisions:` count.
   - If Decisions > 0: read the `## Decisions` section from the plan file
   - For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
   - For each `recommended` decision: present as a group — "The plan has {N} recommended decisions with defaults. Accept all defaults, or review individually?"
   - Record user choices: edit the plan file, replace `**Recommendation:**` with `**Chosen:** {user's choice}`
9. Auto-select verification speed: count tasks in the returned plan file.
   If task count < 5: mark `--fast` flag for Step 3 (use Sonnet for verification).
   If task count ≥ 5: no flag (use Opus default).

### Step 2.5: UX Review (conditional)

**Trigger condition:** The design doc contains a `## UX Assertions` section with at least one assertion row (not just the header). If no design doc, no UX Assertions section, or the table has zero assertion rows, skip to Step 3.

1. Update state: `phase_step: ux-review`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Read the generated plan file
3. Read the design doc's `## UX Assertions` table and `## User Journeys` section
4. Build a mapping table:

For each UX assertion:
- Find plan tasks with `UX ref: UX-NNN` matching this assertion
- Extract the task's `User interaction:` line (if present)

For each UI-facing plan task without a `UX ref:`:
- Note as unmapped

5. Present to user:

```
UX Assertion Coverage:

| UX ID | Assertion | Plan Task(s) | User Interaction | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| UX-001 | {assertion text} | Task 3, Task 5 | {from task's User interaction: line, or "—"} | ✅ Mapped |
| UX-002 | {assertion text} | — | — | ❌ No task |
| UX-003 | {assertion text} | Task 7 | {from task} | ✅ Mapped |

Unmapped UI tasks (no UX ref):
- Task 4: {task title} — {reason or "needs UX assertion?"}

Confirm this mapping is correct, or provide corrections.
```

6. Wait for user response:
   - **User confirms**: proceed to Step 3
   - **User provides corrections**:
     - For minor fixes (add/correct `UX ref:` lines, adjust `User interaction:` text): edit the plan file directly
     - For structural changes (add missing tasks, redesign task scope): re-dispatch `dev-workflow:plan-writer` with a correction prompt listing the required additions
     - Re-present the mapping for confirmation after corrections
   - Max 2 correction cycles; after that, proceed with noted gaps

7. Update state: `last_updated: <now>`

### Step 3: Verify

1. Update state: `phase_step: verify`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Invoke `dev-workflow:verify-plan` with the plan from Step 2 (pass `--fast` flag if set in Step 2)
3. Update state: `verification_report: <summary>`, `last_updated: <now>`

**If still "Must revise" after 2 revision cycles:**
Present the remaining issues to the user:
> "Plan verification failed after 2 revision attempts. Remaining issues:
> [list specific issues from verifier output]
>
> Options:
> A. Stop and manually revise the plan, then re-run this step
> B. Proceed with imperfect plan (issues noted in execution — treat as extra caution points)"

Wait for user choice. If A: stop. If B: mark state `verification_report: "partial"` and continue.

### Step 4: Execute (main context)

1. Update state: `phase_step: execute`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Invoke `dev-workflow:execute-plan` to execute the verified plan
   - This stays in the main context because it writes code and needs checkpoint approval
3. When execution completes, update state: `last_updated: <now>`

### Step 5: Document Features (agent dispatch)

1. Update state: `phase_step: spec`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Check the Phase scope for completed user journeys
   - Infrastructure-only Phase (no user journeys): skip to Step 6
3. For each completed feature:
   - Confirm feature name and scope with the user
   - Use the Task tool to dispatch the `dev-workflow:feature-spec-writer` agent:

```
Generate a feature spec with the following inputs:

Feature name: {name}
Feature scope: {scope}
Design doc paths:
{relevant design doc paths and sections}
Dev-guide: {dev-guide path} Phase {N}
Key implementation files:
{list of key files}
Project root: {project root}
```

4. Present spec summary when agent returns
5. **Decision Points:** Check the feature-spec-writer's return for `Decisions:` count.
   - If Decisions > 0: read the `## Decisions` section from the spec file
   - For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
   - For each `recommended` decision: present as a group — "The spec has {N} recommended decisions with defaults. Accept all defaults, or review individually?"
   - Record user choices: edit the spec file, replace `**Recommendation:**` with `**Chosen:** {user's choice}`
6. Update state: `last_updated: <now>`

### Step 6: Reviews (parallel agent dispatch)

1. Update state: `phase_step: review`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Determine which reviews to run from the Phase's Review checklist:
   - **Always:** `dev-workflow:implementation-reviewer` agent
   - **If Phase modified UI files:** `/ui-review`
   - **If Phase created new pages/components:** `/design-review`
   - **If Phase completed a full user journey:** `/feature-review`
   - **If this is the submission prep Phase:** `/submission-preview`
3. Dispatch ALL applicable review agents **in parallel** using the Task tool in a single message:
   - `dev-workflow:implementation-reviewer` agent (always): pass plan file path + project root
   - `ios-development:ui-reviewer` (if UI files modified): pass list of modified `*View.swift` files
   - `ios-development:design-reviewer` (if new pages/components): pass list of new View files
   - `ios-development:feature-reviewer` (if full user journey completed): pass feature scope + key files
   - `dev-workflow:implementation-reviewer` handles plan vs code; ios agents handle quality

   Each agent receives a fresh context — they have no memory of how the code was written.
   This removes confirmation bias from self-review.
4. When all return: each agent returns a compact summary with verdict, issue counts, and report file path. Present a consolidated summary table:

| Review | Verdict | Issues | Report |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Implementation | ✅/❌ | {counts} | {path} |
| UI | ✅/❌ | {counts} | {path} |
| Design | ✅/❌ | {counts} | {path} |
| Feature | ✅/❌ | {counts} | {path} |

5. Update state: `review_reports: [<report file paths from agent summaries>]`, `last_updated: <now>`

### Step 7: Fix Gaps

If any review found issues:

1. Update state: `phase_step: fix`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Read the relevant review report files (paths from Step 6 summaries) to get full issue details
3. List all gaps sorted by severity (critical first, then warnings)
4. Ask the user: "Fix these gaps before moving on, or mark as known issues?"
5. If fixing: address the gaps, then re-run only the reviews that had failures
6. If skipping: note the known issues and proceed
7. Update state: `gaps_remaining: <count>`, `last_updated: <now>`
8. **Decision Points:** Check each review report for `Decisions:` count.
   - If any report has Decisions > 0: read the `## Decisions` section from that report
   - For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
   - For each `recommended` decision: present as a group — "Reviews have {N} recommended decisions with defaults. Accept all defaults, or review individually?"
   - Record user choices: edit the report file, replace `**Recommendation:**` with `**Chosen:** {user's choice}`
   - Then proceed to Step 8

### Step 8: Phase Completion

1. Update state: `phase_step: done`, `last_updated: <now>`
2. Update the dev-guide:
   - Check off this Phase's acceptance criteria
   - Add status line: `**Status:** ✅ Completed — YYYY-MM-DD` after the Phase heading
3. Remind the user to update project docs:
   - `docs/07-changelog/` — record changes
   - `docs/03-decisions/` — if architectural decisions were made
4. Report:

> Phase N complete.
> Next: Phase N+1 — [name]: [goal].
> Run `/run-phase` to continue, or `/commit` to save progress first.

## Rules

- **Never skip Step 6.** Reviews are not optional.
- **Never skip verification.** Step 3 must run before Step 4.
- **Phase order matters.** Don't start Phase N+1 if Phase N has unchecked acceptance criteria (unless user explicitly overrides).
- **Consolidate review output.** Merge all review results into one summary with sections.
- **State before action.** Update state file before starting each step, not after.

## Completion Criteria

- Phase acceptance criteria checked off in dev-guide (Step 8)
- State file `phase_step` set to `done`
- Next phase communicated to user
