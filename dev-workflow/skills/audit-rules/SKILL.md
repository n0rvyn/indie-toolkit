## Overview

This skill dispatches the `dev-workflow:rules-auditor` agent to audit CLAUDE.md rules in a separate context so it starts with a fresh, unbiased perspective.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the following before dispatching:

1. **Deviation description** — from the user's message (e.g., "Claude added animations without asking"). Set to "periodic check" if none provided
2. **Global CLAUDE.md path** — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. **Project CLAUDE.md path** — check for `CLAUDE.md` in project root (may not exist)
4. **Installed plugin behaviors** — discover installed plugins and collect their behavioral surface:
   - Glob `~/.claude/plugins/*/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to find installed plugins
   - For each plugin found:
     - Read `hooks/hooks.json` (if exists) — extract hook events, matchers, and script paths
     - Read each hook shell script to extract the behavioral description (first comment line after shebang)
     - Glob `skills/*/SKILL.md` — extract frontmatter `description` field from each
   - Compile into a structured summary per plugin:
     ```
     Plugin: {name}
     Hooks:
     - {Event}({Matcher}): {description from script comment}
     - ...
     Skills:
     - {name}: "{description from frontmatter}"
     - ...
     ```
   - If no plugins found: pass "No plugins installed" to agent

### Step 2: Dispatch Agent

Use the Agent tool to launch the `dev-workflow:rules-auditor` agent with all gathered context. Structure the task prompt as:

```
Audit CLAUDE.md rules with the following inputs:

Deviation description: {description or "periodic check"}
Global CLAUDE.md: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Project CLAUDE.md: {path or "none"}
Installed plugin behaviors:
{compiled plugin behavior summary, or "No plugins installed"}
```

### Step 3: Present Results

When the agent completes:

1. **Validate DP count**: Parse the `Decisions:` line for N+M total, count actual `DP-\d+` entries in headings. If mismatch, prepend warning to report: `⚠️ 报告声称 {N+M} 个决策点，实际只列了 {actual} 个。以实际条目为准。`
2. Present the Rules Review Report returned by the agent
3. **Decision Points:** Check the agent's return for `Decisions:` count.
   - If Decisions > 0:
     - First time this session: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/decision-points.md`
     - Apply the rules with parameters:
       - Source file: the audit report
       - Mode: `mixed`
       - Recording: `conversation-only`
4. If fix recommendations were made:
   - List each recommendation
   - Ask the user: "Execute these fixes?"
5. If user approves: apply the recommended changes to the CLAUDE.md files
6. If user declines: done

## Completion Criteria

- Audit report presented to user
- If fixes recommended: user has approved or declined each recommendation
- If approved: changes applied to CLAUDE.md files
