# Elevator Pitch Test

**Purpose:** If you can't explain the value concisely, you haven't found the value.

## Default Constraints

- Short tagline: <=30 characters
- Plus first description sentence: one line that makes users act
- Combined: tagline + sentence must convey the core value proposition

## Judgment Criteria

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Clear | Tagline + sentence immediately convey value; target user would act |
| Vague | Value is there but expression is unclear; needs refinement |
| Cannot articulate | Cannot express value concisely; signals unclear product vision |

## Process

1. Attempt to write the tagline + sentence based on product understanding
2. Judge: would the target user understand what this does AND why they need it?
3. If "cannot articulate": this signals the product vision needs clarification, not just the copy

## Output Format

```markdown
## Elevator Pitch Test

> **Tagline:** [<=30 chars]
> **Description:** [one sentence]
>
> **Verdict:** [Clear / Vague / Cannot articulate]
> [One-sentence reasoning]
```

## Platform Constraints

### iOS

Replace the generic constraints with App Store-specific:
- App Store subtitle: <=30 characters
- First App Store description sentence: makes users tap "Get"
- Combined: a stranger browsing the App Store understands what this does AND why they need it

**Judgment context:** Users scanning the App Store quickly, not reading carefully.
