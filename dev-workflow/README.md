# dev-workflow

Cross-stack development workflow plugin for Claude Code. Provides a full plan-execute-review lifecycle with fresh-context agent dispatching.

## Architecture

Heavy document-generation and analysis tasks run as **agents** (fresh context) dispatched via the Task tool, so each agent starts with an unbiased perspective. Interactive tasks that need user input or write code stay as **skills** in the main context. The `run-phase` orchestrator dispatches agents and coordinates the sequence.

```
run-phase (orchestrator, main context)
  → design-analyzer agent (opus)       → design analysis file
  → plan-writer agent (sonnet)         → plan file on disk
  → plan-verifier agent (opus)         → verification report
  → execute-plan skill                 → code changes (main context)
  → feature-spec-writer agent (sonnet) → spec file
  → review agents (parallel)           → consolidated findings
  → fix gaps                           → Phase done

finalize (after all phases complete)
  → full test suite (0 fail, 0 skip)
  → cross-phase criteria regression
  → cumulative test coverage audit     → validation report
```

## Agent Dispatch Guidelines

### Explore-Intent Dispatch

When dispatching a subagent (via Agent tool) for exploration/understanding purposes, include this instruction in the dispatch prompt:

> Return your findings as:
> 1. Summary (3-5 sentences): what you found, key patterns, notable concerns
> 2. Key files (5-10): `{file_path} — {one-line relevance}`
> 3. Do NOT paste full file contents into your response.

The main context reads specific files as needed based on the returned list.

This pattern applies to "understand X" / "explore Y" dispatches. Verification agents ("verify X" / "audit Y") should continue returning inline evidence.

## Hooks

| Event | Script | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| SessionStart | check-workflow-state.sh | Detects in-progress phase, prompts resume |
| PreToolUse (Bash) | scan-secrets.sh | Intercepts git commit, blocks if secrets detected in staged content |
| UserPromptSubmit | suggest-skills.sh | Pattern-matches user prompt and suggests relevant skills |
| SessionEnd | prompt-lesson.sh | Prompts lesson collection if session had significant work |

## Workflow State

`run-phase` persists progress to `.claude/dev-workflow-state.yml`, enabling cross-session resume. The SessionStart hook detects this file and prompts the user to continue.

## Design Principles

- Bug fix, plan verification, and design decision skills use universal methodology (value domain tracing, reverse reasoning, entry point uniqueness, complexity analysis) that works across tech stacks.
- iOS-specific checks (Design Token consistency, Swift concurrency) are provided by the `apple-dev` plugin's references.
- Document-generation tasks (plans, specs, guides, audits) run in separate agent contexts so each starts with a fresh, unbiased perspective.
