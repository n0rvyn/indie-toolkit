# Decision Points: Presentation & Recording

This reference is consumed by skill DP handling steps. Not user-facing.

**Consuming skills** (as of this writing):
- `write-plan` Step 3 #2 — plan file, mode `full`, recording default
- `verify-plan` Step 3 #5 — verification report, mode `mixed`, recording default
- `run-phase` Step 2 #9 — plan file, mode `full`, recording default
- `run-phase` Step 6 #6 — spec file, mode `full`, recording default
- `run-phase` Step 7 #8 — review report, mode `mixed`, recording default
- `understand-design` — design-analysis file, mode `mixed`, recording default
- `design-drift` — drift report, mode `mixed`, recording `conversation-only`
- `write-feature-spec` — spec file, mode `mixed`, recording default
- `audit-rules` — audit report, mode `mixed`, recording `conversation-only`
- `execute-plan` Step 1 #3 — plan file, **inline short-form** (see §"Note on inline variant"), recording default

Each consuming skill declares its parameters (source file path, mode, recording) at the DP handling step and points here for execution.

`execute-plan` intentionally inlines a short-form variant on the mechanical execution hot path — see §"Note on inline variant" below.

**Non-consumers** (intentionally excluded):
- `write-dev-guide` uses a custom table-based DP UX (方案/描述与代价 columns, per-decision AskUserQuestion with "(推荐)" marker on the recommended label) that does not match the group-batching flow described here. It remains an independent pattern.
- `next-increment` documents a mini-spec artifact format that happens to use `**Chosen:**` in its template — it is not a DP handling step.

## Core Principle

**Source files** (plan / spec / report) hold DP blocks in professional format:

```
### [DP-NNN] {title} ({blocking | recommended})

**Context:** ...
**Options:**
- A: ... — {trade-off}
- B: ... — {trade-off}
**Recommendation:** ... — {reason, 1 sentence}
```

This format is the **durable record** for `execute-plan`, `plan-verifier`, and future readers. **Do not modify** Context / Options / evidence body. The `**Recommendation:**` line is replaced with `**Chosen:**` only after the user decides (see §Recording).

The `question` field of `AskUserQuestion` is **a conversation, not a spec dump**. Translate the DP to plain language for the question field only. Never paste verbatim DP Markdown into the `question` field — formal blocks cause users to skim and click "accept all" without engaging.

## Modes

### `full`

For DPs representing real architectural, scope, product, or design tradeoffs the user must weigh, rewrite each DP inside the `question` field using the structure below.

**Core requirement:** Use product / user-observable vocabulary throughout. **Do not** use code identifiers (type names, file names, enum cases, variable names, method names) anywhere in the question field. The user did not write the code; `PagodaSwitcherCard.scoreBadge` does not map to anything they recognize in the running app.

**Reference — use the left, never the right:**

| User-observable | Do not use |
|------|-------|
| "膳食宝塔卡片右上角的 65 分按钮" | `PagodaSwitcherCard.scoreBadge` |
| "经典视图模式" / "金字塔模式" / "盛开模式" | `.legacy` / `.pyramid` / `.bloom` mode |
| "弹出评分详情" | `showScoreSheet = true` |
| "卡片标题栏" | `headerRow` |
| "添加食物的按钮" | `AddFoodButton` |

**Structure (keep all four fields and the A/B/C bullets — only the language inside changes):**

1. **Why this choice matters** — describe the current state and what breaks or changes if no choice is made. Length follows content density: short when the situation is simple, longer when it needs context. Do not impose an arbitrary sentence limit.
2. **Each option** — one bullet per option, prefixed with the original `A:` / `B:` / `C:` label. **Always preserve the label** so the user's answer maps back to the source file. Each bullet describes what the user will see, do, or lose if this option is chosen — not what the code will do.
3. **Recommended + why** — which option is recommended, with a practical user-facing reason (not architectural reasoning like "lower coupling" or "extends the existing pattern").
4. **Tradeoff** — what the user gives up if the recommendation is accepted, described in terms the user can perceive.

**Worked example — the same DP, before and after:**

**Before (code-language — what triggers "说人话" pushback):**

> ### [DP-006] PagodaSwitcherCard 在 .legacy mode 下 score badge 入口位置 (blocking)
>
> **Context:** 原计划中，.legacy 模式下叠入 PyramidCardContent 时，`showInternalHeader: false` 会跳过整个 headerRow，而 PagodaSwitcherCard 自己的 headerRow 不含 scoreBadge—— 用户会丢失 PyramidScoreSheet 入口（可见回归）。
>
> **Options:**
> - A: PagodaSwitcherCard.headerRow 内追加 scoreBadge，仅在 mode=.legacy 时可见，wire 到 PagodaSwitcherCard 自己的 showScoreSheet = true
> - B: PagodaSwitcherCard.headerRow 始终显示 scoreBadge（三模式共享）
> - C: 接受 .legacy 下 score badge 缺失，依赖 "问 AI" 按钮替代
>
> **Recommendation:** B — `PyramidCardView.swift:148-165` 展示 scoreBadge 是现有用户路径

**After (user-language — what to put in the `question` field):**

> **背景：** 膳食宝塔卡片右上角现在有一个圆圈写着 "65 分"，点它可以弹出评分详情。加了视图切换器之后，在经典视图模式下这个评分按钮会消失，用户会丢失一个本来一直能用的入口。怎么处理？
>
> **选项：**
> - **A:** 只在切到经典视图模式时显示这个评分按钮，金字塔和盛开模式下藏起来
> - **B:** 三个模式都显示这个评分按钮，统一行为
> - **C:** 不放回来，让用户改用旁边的 "问 AI" 按钮获取评分反馈
>
> **推荐 B：** 三个模式都能看到评分按钮，不会因为切换模式就丢失功能；用户也不需要记住"哪个模式才能看评分"。
>
> **代价：** 盛开模式已经在大字 32pt 显示总分，再加一个评分按钮圆圈会有视觉重复。

The After version preserves all four field labels and the three independent A/B/C bullets — what changed is *only the words inside*. Code identifiers were replaced with names the user recognizes from the actual running app.

### `short`

For routine verifier/reviewer findings in confirm/reject style (e.g., "add this missing test", "tighten this assertion"). A one-line summary of what the verifier/reviewer recommends + options with original `A:` / `B:` / `C:` labels. Full translation is not needed — the user is mostly confirming the finding.

### `mixed`

Classify each DP at read time:
- Options are different approaches / scope tradeoffs → apply `full`.
- Options are "fix now / defer" or "accept / reject finding" style → apply `short`.

When uncertain, default to `full` — over-translating is less harmful than under-translating.

## Language Rule

Use the conversation's language. If the ongoing conversation has been in Chinese, write the question in Chinese; if English, English. **Do not mix CN and EN within a single presentation.**

## Presentation Flow

### Blocking decisions

Each `blocking` decision is presented individually via its own `AskUserQuestion` using the translated form.

### Recommended decisions

Present as a group via a single `AskUserQuestion`. **Critical constraints:**

- All translated content must be inside the `question` field. Text printed before `AskUserQuestion` gets visually covered by the widget.
- Separate multiple DPs with `\n---\n`.
- End the `question` field with: `\n\n全部接受推荐，还是逐个审查？`

If the user does **not** choose "accept all": present each DP individually via separate `AskUserQuestion` calls. **Do not assume any DP is accepted** until the user explicitly confirms it.

### User pushback

If the user pushes back **before answering** with signals like "说人话" / "explain plainly" / "I don't understand" / "再说一次": the translation was weak. Redo it — re-read the DP body, rewrite with more concrete user-facing consequences — and re-ask.

If the user pushes back **after answering**: treat as a new round of questions on the same DP, not a retranslation. Do not overwrite the recorded choice unless the user explicitly says to.

## Recording Choices

### Default recording (`recording: default`)

Edit the source file; replace `**Recommendation:**` or `**Recommendation (unverified):**` with:

```
**Chosen:** Option {A | B | C}
```

Use the original A/B/C label the DP was written with. **Do not modify** the DP's Context / Options / evidence body — they remain for future readers.

This is what downstream consumers depend on:
- `execute-plan` (the skill) edits the plan file to record `**Chosen:**` *before* dispatching the agent, so every Task the agent executes sees settled decisions. Future audits and resumed sessions also read these lines.
- `plan-verifier` agent reads `**Chosen:**` entries as "Previously resolved decisions" to avoid re-asking settled questions on re-verification.

### Conversation-only recording (`recording: conversation-only`)

Some skills (`design-drift`, `audit-rules`) produce DPs from transient findings — drift items or rule-audit recommendations — that don't belong in a long-lived plan or spec. For these:

- Record the user's choice in the ongoing conversation only (note which option was chosen for each DP).
- **Do not write `**Chosen:**` back to the source file.**
- Downstream handling varies by skill:
  - **Same-skill consumption**: `audit-rules` Step 4-5 reads the conversation record to decide which fixes to apply in the current run.
  - **Advisory handoff**: `design-drift` ends after presenting findings; the user carries the choices forward into follow-up work (doc updates, issue creation) outside this skill.

## Note on Inline Variant

`execute-plan/SKILL.md` intentionally inlines a ~7-line **short-form** DP handler for pre-dispatch DP resolution. Rationale:

- execute-plan is the mechanical executor — its ethos is "no judgment calls." Reading this reference file on a hot dispatch path adds indirection without much benefit, since by the time execute-plan runs, most DPs have already been resolved by `write-plan` or `verify-plan`. The inline block is the dispatcher of last resort.
- The inline handler applies `short` mode + `default` recording; it does NOT paste verbatim DP Markdown into the `question` field (that rule from §"Core Principle" binds everywhere, including execute-plan).

**When the rules in this file evolve** (presentation flow, recording format, A/B/C label convention, short-form shape), **check `execute-plan/SKILL.md` Step 1 #3** and keep it in sync manually. The execute-plan inline block should remain a lean subset of this reference, not a divergent fork.
