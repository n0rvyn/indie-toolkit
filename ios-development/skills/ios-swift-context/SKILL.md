## Purpose

Load the relevant sections of `references/ios-swift-rules.md` based on the current task. Do not read the entire file unless the task requires rules from every section.

## Section-Targeted Reading Process

### Step 1: Identify relevant sections

Grep for section markers in the file:

```
Grep("<!-- section:", "references/ios-swift-rules.md")
```

This returns lines like:
```
3:<!-- section: Build-Check-Fix Cycle keywords: build, xcodebuild, check, fix -->
```

### Step 2: Match sections to current task

From the current task description, identify which keyword sets are relevant:

| Task involves | Read section(s) |
|---|---|
| Running builds, checking errors | Build-Check-Fix Cycle |
| Any Swift code (always apply) | 通用约束 |
| async/await, actors, @Model, Sendable | Swift 6 并发原则 |
| Existing foregroundColor calls | .foregroundColor 迁移策略 |
| Creating new UI, layout changes | iOS UI 规则（分层生效） |
| New triggers, data paths, schedulers | 计划阶段架构审查（条件触发） |
| Plan with ≥3 file changes | 计划自检（M&M 测试） |
| Writing a plan | 计划编写原则 |
| Starting execution of a plan | 计划执行原则 |
| Interruption during execution | 计划执行中断处理（必须遵守） |
| User reported a behavior bug | 错误修复原则 |
| Deleting code or variables | 删除代码原则, 死代码/未接入代码处置原则 |
| Working with iOS 18 APIs (@Entry, Tab, MeshGradient, @Previewable) | swift-api-changes-ios18 |
| Working with iOS 26 APIs (glassEffect, FoundationModels) | swift-api-changes-ios26 |
| Seeing deprecation warnings in Xcode | swift-api-changes-ios18 (migration), validate-design-tokens |
| Using TabView | swift-api-changes-ios18 → TabView Architecture |
| Adding LLM/AI features | swift-api-changes-ios26 → Foundation Models |

### Step 3: Read only the matched sections

For each matched section in `ios-swift-rules.md`, use the line number from the Grep result as
`offset` and read until the next section marker or approximately 60 lines (whichever comes first):

```
Read("references/ios-swift-rules.md", offset=<section_line>, limit=<next_section_line - section_line>)
```

For `swift-api-changes-*` files: search for the specific section keyword rather than reading
the entire file. Example: if the task involves `glassEffect`, grep for that keyword to find the
section offset, then read only that section:

```
Grep("glassEffect", "references/swift-api-changes-ios26.md")
→ Read("references/swift-api-changes-ios26.md", offset=<section_line>, limit=<lines_to_next_section>)
```

If the task is not clearly scoped (e.g., the task description is very broad or covers the whole codebase), read `通用约束` and `Swift 6 并发原则` at minimum — these two sections apply to all Swift work.

### Step 4: Apply the loaded rules

Follow the rules from the loaded sections strictly. Do not infer rules from memory about sections that were not read.
