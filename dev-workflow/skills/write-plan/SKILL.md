name: write-plan
description: "Use when the user says 'write a plan', 'plan this', 'break this into tasks', or has requirements/specs for a multi-step task before touching code. Creates structured implementation plans with self-contained, verifiable tasks. Not for single-step changes. For phase-driven development, run-phase calls this internally."
---

## Behavior Note

When invoked **standalone** (user runs write-plan directly): this skill automatically chains
to `dev-workflow:verify-plan` at Step 4 — plan writing and verification happen in one flow.

When invoked via **`run-phase`** orchestration: run-phase writes the plan in main context
using the Plan Writing Reference below, and manages verification as a separate explicit step.

## Overview

This skill writes an implementation plan directly in the main context, benefiting from full conversation history and user intent.

## Process

### Step 0: Retrieve Prior Context (if search tool available)

Before gathering context, search for relevant ADRs, architecture decisions, and known pitfalls:

1. Extract 3-5 keywords from the plan goal (component names, technology names, pattern names)
2. Call `search(query="<goal text>", source_type=["doc", "error", "lesson"], project_root="<cwd>")`
3. If results are returned: note them as "Prior context from knowledge base:" for use in Step 2
4. If the search tool is unavailable or returns no results: skip silently and continue to Step 1

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect the following before writing:

1. **Goal** — one sentence describing what the plan achieves (from user request, dev-guide Phase, or conversation context)
2. **Scope items** — list of features/components to implement
3. **Acceptance criteria** — verifiable completion conditions (from dev-guide Phase or user)
4. **Design doc reference** — path to design doc if one exists (search `docs/06-plans/*-design.md`). If found, read it.
5. **Design analysis reference** — path to design analysis if one exists (search `docs/06-plans/*-design-analysis.md`). If found, read it: it contains validated token mappings, platform translations, and UX assertion validation from a visual prototype.
6. **Crystal file reference** — path to crystallized decisions file if one exists (search `docs/11-crystals/*-crystal.md`). If found, read it: it contains settled architectural and UX decisions with machine-readable D-xxx assertions the plan must respect.
7. **Project root** — current working directory

If any of these are unclear, ask the user before writing.

### Step 2: Write Plan

Read relevant source files (design docs, existing code the plan will touch, crystal files) to understand the current state. Then write the plan following the **Plan Writing Reference** below.

Save the plan to `docs/06-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>-plan.md`.

### Step 3: Present and Verify

After writing the plan:

1. Present a summary to the user:
   - Plan file path
   - Number of tasks
   - Key files to be created/modified
2. **Decision Points:** Check the `## Decisions` section of the plan file.
   - If Decisions > 0: read the section
   - For each `blocking` decision: present to user via AskUserQuestion with options from the decision point
   - For `recommended` decisions: present as a group via a single AskUserQuestion. **Critical:** all DP content must be inside the `question` field — text printed before AskUserQuestion gets visually covered by the question widget. Read each recommended DP's full block (heading + Context + Options + Recommendation) from the source file and concatenate them verbatim in the question field, separated by `\n---\n`. End with: `\n\n全部接受推荐，还是逐个审查？`
   - If the user does NOT choose to accept all: present each DP individually via separate AskUserQuestion calls. Do not assume any DP is accepted until the user explicitly confirms it
   - Record user choices: edit the plan file, replace the `**Recommendation:**` or `**Recommendation (unverified):**` line with `**Chosen:** {user's choice}`
3. Invoke `dev-workflow:verify-plan` to validate the plan before execution

## Completion Criteria

- Plan file written to `docs/06-plans/`
- Verification invoked and plan approved (or user chose to proceed with noted issues)

## Plan Writing Reference

This section contains the plan document format, scope guards, and writing guidelines. Referenced by both this skill and `run-phase` Step 2.

### Core Principle

Write plans assuming the implementing engineer has zero context. Document everything: files to touch, code snippets, commands, expected output.

### Scope Guards

1. **Absence != deletion**: If the current codebase has functionality X that is not mentioned in the scope items, X's status is "unchanged" (keep as-is). Only create deletion/removal tasks when the scope explicitly says "remove", "delete", "移除", or "删除" for that functionality. Design docs showing a target state without feature X does NOT authorize removing X — that's a UX change requiring explicit user instruction in the scope. Exception: if a crystal `[D-xxx]` decision explicitly calls for removal/replacement, that decision overrides this guard (D-xxx decisions represent user-confirmed intent).

2. **Scope boundary compliance** (when crystal file has `## Scope Boundaries`):
   - IN items: plan tasks should cover these
   - OUT items: plan tasks must NOT touch these areas. If a task would need to modify an OUT item to complete an IN item, add a `**Scope conflicts:**` subsection after `**Crystal file:**` in the plan header: `IN: {item} requires modifying OUT: {item} — {why}`. Do not create the conflicting task; let the verifier and user resolve it.

3. **No scope inference**: Decomposing a scope item into implementation steps is expected (e.g., "migrate color tokens" → one task per token category). But adding work that addresses a DIFFERENT concern not in the scope items is prohibited, even if it seems like a natural extension (e.g., scope says "migrate color tokens" → adding a font migration task is scope inference). If you believe additional work is necessary, note it in the plan header as "Recommended additions (not in scope)" — do not create tasks for it.

4. **Quality fidelity** — If the design doc specifies a concrete approach for a feature (e.g., "LLM analysis", "Bree cron scheduler", "WordPiece tokenizer"), the plan task MUST implement that exact approach. If the specified approach is not feasible in this phase (missing dependency, API not available, infrastructure not ready), the task must:
   - Mark the task title with `⚠️ SIMPLIFIED:`
   - Add a `**Simplification:**` field explaining what was changed and why
   - Add a `**Design approach:**` field stating the original design's approach
   - Add a `**Blocking dependency:**` field if the simplification is due to a dependency not yet available (informational for human reviewers; not consumed by automated verification)
   Silently replacing a design-specified approach with a simpler alternative (heuristic, placeholder, stub) without these annotations is prohibited.

### Plan Document Format

```markdown
---
type: plan
status: active
tags: [tag1, tag2]
refs: []
---

# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences on approach and key decisions]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies and frameworks]

**Design doc:** [path to design doc, if one exists — links to verify-plan DF strategy]

**Design analysis:** [path to design analysis, if one exists]

**Crystal file:** [path to crystal file, if one exists — links to verify-plan CF strategy]

---
```

### Task Structure

Each task should be a coherent unit of work. Don't force artificial granularity — a task can be small or substantial as long as it's self-contained and verifiable.

```markdown
<!-- section: task-N keywords: keyword1, keyword2 -->
### Task N: [Component/Feature Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.ext`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ext:line-range`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.ext`

**Steps:**
1. [Clear instruction with code snippet if needed]
2. [Next step]
3. [Verification step with exact command and expected output]

**Verify:**
Run: `<exact command>`
Expected: <what success looks like>
<!-- /section -->
```

### Optional Design Anchor Fields

When a task implements part of a design document, add these fields to help execution stay faithful:

```markdown
**Design ref:** [design-doc.md § Section Name]
**Expected values:** [key concrete values from design that must appear in code]
**Replaces:** [what existing code/pattern this replaces, if any]
**Data flow:** [source → transform → destination]
**Quality markers:** [specific acceptance criteria beyond "it works"]
**Verify after:** [verification specific to design faithfulness]
**UX ref:** [UX-NNN from design doc's UX Assertions table — which assertion(s) this task fulfills]
**User interaction:** [what the user sees and does — derived from User Journeys, not invented]
```

These fields are optional per-task. Use them when the task has design-critical details that could drift during implementation.

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Complete file paths** — always absolute from project root
2. **Actual code** — not pseudocode, not "implement X here"
3. **Exact commands** — copy-pasteable verification commands with expected output
   - **Task-level `Verify:` scope**: each task's Verify should contain only that task's specific checks (grep for expected strings, type-check a single file, run a single test file). Full build/test suite belongs exclusively in the final verification task (guideline 11). Do not put `npm run build`, `npm test`, `swift build`, `xcodebuild test`, or equivalent full-suite commands in intermediate task Verify sections.
4. **Dependencies explicit** — if Task 3 depends on Task 1, say so
5. **No forced TDD** — write tests where they add value; don't mandate test-first for every step
6. **Reasonable task size** — self-contained and independently verifiable; not artificially split
7. **Task section markers:** Each `### Task N:` block is wrapped in `<!-- section: task-N keywords: {kw1}, {kw2} -->` ... `<!-- /section -->`. Keywords are derived from the task's `**Files:**` paths and the technologies/APIs the task touches. Use the leaf file name (without extension) and key technology names. 2-4 keywords per task.
8. **UX-aware tasks** — when the design doc has a `## UX Assertions` section: read the User Journeys and UX Assertions table before writing any UI task. Each task that implements user-visible behavior must include `UX ref:` pointing to the assertion ID(s) it fulfills, and a brief `User interaction:` line describing what the user sees and does (derived from the User Journeys, not invented). Tasks that touch UI but don't map to any UX assertion should be flagged with `⚠️ No UX ref: [reason]`
9. **Frontmatter fields:** `type` is always `plan`. `status` is always `active` when first written. `tags` — derive 2-5 keywords from the feature name and key technologies in the tasks (e.g., tasks touching SwiftData and sync → `[swiftdata, sync, offline]`). `refs` — list the design doc path and crystal file path from the plan header (if set to a real path, not "none").
10. **Intelligent test assessment** — evaluate test requirements based on code type, not blanket rules (supplements item 5):
    - **Business logic** (algorithms, data transformations, validation): needs Unit Tests
    - **User journeys** (end-to-end flows, API integrations): needs E2E Tests
    - **Performance-critical** (rendering, data processing, large datasets): needs Performance Tests
    - **UI components** (views, controls, animations): needs Snapshot Tests or UI Tests
    - When a task involves any of these code types, either:
      a. Create a separate test task with appropriate test type, OR
      b. Embed test verification steps in the functional task's `**Verify:**` section
    - Platform-specific test implementations can reference apple-dev plugin skills:
      - UT/Mock/TDD → `apple-dev:testing-guide`
      - E2E/Snapshot/A11y → `apple-dev:xc-ui-test`
      - Performance → `apple-dev:profiling`
    - This supplements item 5 (No forced TDD) — tests are recommended where they add value, not mandated for every task
11. **Final verification task** — Every plan must end with a verification task that runs the project's full build and test suite. Before writing this task:
    a. Scan project root for build system files (`package.json`, `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`)
    b. For each build system found: read the file and extract all build/test commands (e.g., `scripts` in package.json, targets in Makefile)
    c. Detect sub-projects: scan for nested directories with their own build system files (e.g., `web/package.json`, `packages/*/package.json`). Include their test commands too.
    d. Detect package manager: check for lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `package-lock.json` → npm, `bun.lockb` → bun)
    e. Write the final task with ALL discovered commands in `**Verify:**`. Group by project/sub-project:
       ```
       ### Task N: Full verification
       **Verify:**
       Run: `pnpm typecheck`
       Run: `pnpm test`
       Run: `cd web && pnpm test`
       Expected: All pass with zero failures
       ```
    f. If the project has separate test categories (unit, e2e, integration), list each command. Do NOT collapse to a single generic command unless that single command truly runs everything.

### Crystal File Integration

When a crystal file is provided: ensure every `[D-xxx]` decision is reflected in at least one plan task. Rejected alternatives in the crystal must not appear as plan tasks. Add `Crystal ref: [D-xxx]` to task headers that implement specific decisions.

### Design Analysis Integration

When a design analysis is provided: read it and incorporate token mappings, platform translations, and UX assertion validations into the relevant plan tasks.

### Decisions

If any planning finding requires a user choice before execution can proceed, output a `## Decisions` section in the plan document. If no decisions needed, output `## Decisions\nNone.`

Format per decision:

```
### [DP-001] {title} ({blocking / recommended})

**Context:** {why this decision is needed, 1-2 sentences}
**Options:**
- A: {description} — {trade-off}
- B: {description} — {trade-off}
**Recommendation:** {option} — {reason, 1 sentence}
```

**Recommendation quality rule:**
- Recommendations must cite code evidence (file:line or structural reasoning grounded in specific code). Example: "Option A; `Router.swift:42` shows routes are registered centrally, extending that pattern is lower-risk"
- If code evidence is unavailable (decision about a new pattern with no existing precedent): use `**Recommendation (unverified):**` instead of `**Recommendation:**`, and state why evidence is absent
- Self-check: remove the recommendation. Can a reader reach the same conclusion by following the cited evidence? If not, the evidence is insufficient

Priority levels:
- `blocking` — must be resolved before plan execution; the dispatcher will ask the user via AskUserQuestion
- `recommended` — has a sensible default but user should confirm; dispatcher presents as batch

Common decision triggers for plan writing:
- Scope conflicts detected (IN item conflicts with OUT item) → resolve or exclude (blocking)
- Recommended additions identified (needed but not in scope) → add to scope or defer (recommended)
- `**Replaces:**` patterns where old code removal is non-trivial → confirm removal (blocking)
